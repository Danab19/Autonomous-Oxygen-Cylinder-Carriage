# 🤖 Development and Fabrication of an Autonomous Oxygen Cylinder Carriage

## 📘 Project Overview

This capstone project presents the **design, development, and fabrication** of an **autonomous robotic carriage** to transport oxygen cylinders for children diagnosed with Children’s Interstitial Lung Disease (CHILD). The device is engineered to carry two different oxygen cylinders and follow the patient autonomously using a combination of sensors and microcontrollers.
